/**
*   Part 1.
* Design, create and test a C++ console application. The application should:
* Read all files in a specified folder (assume they are ascii).
* For each file, ascertain:
*  - The longest word
*  - The shortest word
*  - The total word count
*  - The number of occurrences of one or more specified words.
* Produce a design, including a simple class diagram – use Powerpoint
* Explain how it was (or could be tested) – again use Powerpoint
* The implementation should demonstrate, as far as possible:
*  - Abstraction
*  - Inheritance
*  - Use of the C++ standard library, including smart pointers, and if possible lambdas.
*
*   Part 2.
* Extend the application to scan the subfolders from a specified location (and nested sub folders).
* Consideration should be given to:
*  - Performance
*  - Scalability
*  - Feedback and Instrumentation (logging of progress)
*
* Document any design and implementation decisions in your Presentation. Try to keep this artefact as simple and coherent as possible.
